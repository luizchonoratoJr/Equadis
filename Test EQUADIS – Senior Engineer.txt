Scenario 1
It's not clear to me what the source, but if I can Tableau for see in report or dinamic Table the analisys.
We can discover the most expensive and cheapest products, in other words what generates the most revenue and the lowest revenue.
We can find out which retailer sells at a more expensive price, or the fair price of the product. We also identify the percentage that each retailer makes on each product.


Scenario 2

Technically the two products are the same. Exactly the same processor and screen settings and for the same functionality
In the second item the word "provides" was writed without "i". 
The durablity described for the first product is "military grade durability", for the second use only the color gray military. 
In my opinion, the first product seems to be more resistant, but the technical performance is the same because the hardware is the same
